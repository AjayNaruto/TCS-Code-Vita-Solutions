Output Format:  
The output is the sum of all the combinations of balls he can pull out modulo 10^9+7 i.e. (1000000007)  
Constraints:  
1. 0<=N,k<=10^9  
2. N >= k  
Sample Input and Output  
**SNo.** **Input** **Output** **Explaination**  
   1 	      4 4       	8 	 	We need 4C0 + 4C2+ 4C4= 1+6+1=8  
   2    	  8 3        29 		We need 8C0 + 8C2= 1+28=29
